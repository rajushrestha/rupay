# About Rupay

## What is Rupay?

Rupay is a platform for developers who want to monetize their software, enabling subscription, billing, payments, and customer management. Built on top of Stripe and inspired by [Polar.sh](https://polar.sh), Rupay provides a comprehensive solution for software monetization.

## The Problem

Stripe is not supported in Nepal. This means Nepalese developers are unable to accept payments globally, limiting their ability to build and scale software businesses internationally. Without access to global payment infrastructure, developers from Nepal face significant barriers to monetizing their software products.

## Our Solution

Rupay addresses this critical gap by providing:

1. **Global Payment Acceptance**: Enable Nepalese developers to accept payments globally, breaking down geographical barriers to software monetization.

2. **Merchant of Record Services**: Act as a global merchant of record, handling taxes and compliance requirements so developers can focus on building their products instead of navigating complex international tax regulations.

3. **Comprehensive Platform**: Provide everything needed for subscription management, billing, payments, and customer management in one integrated platform.

## Our Mission

**Current Focus**: Rupay is launching first in Nepal, empowering Nepalese developers and apps to go global and accept payments worldwide. This marks the beginning of a new era for software businesses in Nepal.

**Future Vision**: After establishing a strong foundation in Nepal, we will expand to other Stripe-unsupported regions, enabling developers worldwide to access global markets and monetize their software products.

## Technology & Inspiration

Rupay is built on top of Stripe's robust payment infrastructure and is deeply inspired by Polar.sh, which has proven this platform concept globally. We leverage proven technologies and adapt them to serve regions that have been underserved by traditional payment platforms.

## Impact

By enabling Nepalese developers to accept global payments, Rupay opens up new business opportunities and helps create a thriving ecosystem for software products from Nepal. This platform empowers developers to build sustainable businesses and compete on a global scale.
